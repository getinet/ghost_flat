The theme, <strong>VOLUME</strong>, explored the relationship between space, environment, and architectural form. As the <strong>Art Director and Graphic Designer</strong>, I was responsible for crafting a visual identity that captured this concept in a compelling and memorable way.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/02/StanfordSpringLectureSeriesPosterV1-mockup.png" class="kg-image" alt="Stanford Spring Lecture Series Posters" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="1024" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/02/StanfordSpringLectureSeriesPosterV1-mockup.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/StanfordSpringLectureSeriesPosterV1-mockup.png 1000w, ../content/images/2025/02/StanfordSpringLectureSeriesPosterV1-mockup.png 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="design-approach"><strong>Design Approach</strong></h4><p>The poster needed to be <strong>visually striking, conceptually rich, and architecturally inspired</strong>. The design strategy included:</p><ul><li><strong>Typography &amp; Dimensionality:</strong> The word <strong>VOLUME</strong> is rendered in a three-dimensional perspective, appearing to rise out of a dense forest&#x2014;symbolizing the intersection of architecture and nature.</li><li><strong>Environmental Integration:</strong> The typography is seamlessly embedded within the landscape, visually reinforcing the dialogue between built form and natural surroundings.</li><li><strong>Minimalist Information Hierarchy:</strong> The lecture details are arranged in a <strong>clean, structured layout</strong>, ensuring legibility while maintaining a modern, design-forward aesthetic.</li><li><strong>Color &amp; Tone:</strong> A rich green forest background evokes <strong>depth, texture, and spatial presence</strong>, tying back to the lecture theme.</li></ul><h4 id="final-deliverables"><strong>Final Deliverables</strong></h4><p>The poster was produced as a <strong>high-quality print</strong>, framed and displayed across the Stanford campus. It successfully set the tone for the lecture series, attracting engagement and reinforcing the university&#x2019;s reputation for forward-thinking design discourse.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flite design studio]]></title><description><![CDATA[As the lead UX/UI designer for Flite Design Studio, I played a key role in shaping the product’s design and user experience.

I worked closely with my UX team to create high-fidelity HTML prototypes, which served as the foundation for our engineering team&#x2019;s development work.</p><p>Our mission was to give designers greater flexibility in building rich, interactive web ads&#x2014;directly in the browser. We wanted the experience to feel as intuitive and powerful as traditional creative tools like Adobe Photoshop. To achieve this, we focused on direct manipulation, drag-and-drop interactions, and context-aware panels. A key innovation was refining our component-based architecture, making it easier for users to integrate functionality like Twitter feeds, YouTube videos, and interactive polls with minimal effort.</p><p>Launched in 2012, Design Studio set the UX standard for our entire product suite. It was well received by customers and consistently praised for its thoughtful, intuitive design.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
